How to Install Webroot Already Purchased?
=========================================

Webroot is a well-known provider of cloud-based cybersecurity solutions that protect against malware, viruses, ransomware, and identity theft. If you have already purchased a Webroot product, such as Webroot SecureAnywhere, your next step is to install the software on your device to begin protection. Many users, however, find themselves unsure of how to proceed after making a purchase — especially if the product was bought online, through a retail card, or included with a new device.

This guide is designed to walk you through the installation process for Webroot on various devices using a product you have already purchased. Whether you're installing for the first time or reinstalling after a system change, the steps outlined here will help you set up your Webroot software quickly and correctly.

Why Proper Installation Matters
-------------------------------

Installing Webroot correctly is important for multiple reasons. A proper installation:

- Activates your subscription and starts your protection period
- Ensures real-time security features are running
- Verifies your product key with Webroot’s cloud system
- Sets up automatic updates and scheduled scans
- Links your software to your Webroot account for future management

Skipping steps or using incorrect installation methods can lead to failed activations, limited protection, or unnecessary troubleshooting.

Pre-Installation Checklist
--------------------------

Before you begin the installation, make sure you have the following:

- A valid Webroot product keycode (20 characters, alphanumeric)
- A stable internet connection
- Administrative privileges on your device
- The correct installation file for your operating system (Windows, macOS, or mobile)

Also, if you're reinstalling on a device that previously had another antivirus, it is recommended to uninstall that software first to avoid conflicts.

Step-by-Step Guide: Installing Webroot After Purchase
-----------------------------------------------------

The following steps apply to users who have already purchased Webroot and are ready to install it on their device.

**Step 1: Locate Your Webroot Keycode**

The keycode is a 20-character alphanumeric code required to activate your product. It is typically found:

- In the confirmation email sent after purchase
- On the back of a physical card or box if purchased at a retail store
- In your online Webroot account dashboard if registered
- On a pre-installed sticker if your device came with Webroot

Have your keycode ready before beginning the installation process.

**Step 2: Download the Installation File**

Open your internet browser and manually go to the official Webroot website. Navigate to the downloads section and select the version that matches your product and device:

- Webroot SecureAnywhere AntiVirus
- Webroot Internet Security Plus
- Webroot Internet Security Complete
- Business Endpoint Protection (for professional users)

Download the appropriate installer for your operating system.

**Step 3: Run the Installer**

Once the installer is downloaded:

- Locate the file in your Downloads folder
- Double-click the installer (`wsainstall.exe` for Windows, `Webroot.dmg` for Mac)
- If prompted by your operating system, confirm that you want to allow the program to make changes

This will begin the Webroot installation wizard.

**Step 4: Enter Your Keycode**

The installer will prompt you to enter your 20-character keycode. Enter it exactly as it appears — it is case-sensitive and must be correct for activation to work.

After entering the keycode, click "Continue" or "Next" to proceed.

**Step 5: Complete Installation and First Scan**

Once the installer verifies your keycode, the software will be installed. After installation:

- Webroot will perform an initial quick scan of your system
- Real-time protection will activate in the background
- You may be asked to create or sign in to a Webroot account for management

The process usually takes just a few minutes and requires minimal user input.

**Step 6: Configure Your Preferences (Optional)**

After installation, you can customize Webroot settings to suit your needs:

- Adjust scanning schedules
- Enable or disable certain types of protection (e.g., firewall, identity shield)
- Set up automatic updates
- Review quarantined items or allowed applications

These features can be accessed via the main dashboard of the application.

Installing Webroot on a Mac
---------------------------

The installation process on a Mac is similar to Windows, with some variations:

- Download the `.dmg` file from the official Webroot site
- Open the disk image and drag the Webroot icon to your Applications folder
- Launch the application and enter your keycode
- Follow on-screen instructions and grant necessary permissions during setup

Ensure that macOS security settings are adjusted if prompted to allow the Webroot extension.

Installing Webroot on Mobile Devices
------------------------------------

Webroot also offers mobile protection apps for Android and iOS. If your license includes mobile device protection:

**For Android:**

- Open the Google Play Store
- Search for “Webroot Mobile Security”
- Download and install the app
- Open the app and sign in with your Webroot account
- Enter your product key if prompted

**For iOS:**

- Visit the App Store
- Search for “Webroot Mobile Security”
- Install the app and sign in to activate it

Please note that mobile apps may offer different features than the desktop versions and may require separate activation steps.

Reinstalling on a New or Reset Device
-------------------------------------

If you're moving Webroot to a new device or reinstalling after a reset:

- Ensure that your subscription allows installation on multiple devices
- Uninstall Webroot from your previous device (if needed)
- Download the installer and enter your existing keycode
- Log into your Webroot account to sync your license and settings

Webroot will recognize the active subscription and begin protection without requiring a new purchase.

Common Installation Issues and Solutions
----------------------------------------

Here are some frequent issues users face during installation and how to resolve them:

**Issue: Keycode Not Accepted**

- Double-check the keycode for typos
- Ensure you are using the correct Webroot version for your product
- Verify that the license is still valid

**Issue: Installation Fails Midway**

- Restart your computer and try again
- Temporarily disable other antivirus software
- Ensure no other installers are running in the background

**Issue: Software Not Running After Installation**

- Reboot your device
- Check for software conflicts
- Reinstall Webroot from scratch
